how to run code :
- install any ruby version
- ruby roman_checker_solved.rb

notes :
- I used ruby because I mastered ruby
- about Golang and Java I am still learning them so I prefered ruby to solve this
- but I created the code as modular as possible

- you can make any input (even complex or extreme)
- it can detect any new line
- it can detect any valid input (with any nominal or not)
- it can detect any valid question (with any nominal or not)
